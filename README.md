# ConsoleWeatherApp
A console app I built in Python to request local weather from OpenWeatherMap and parse the response into user-friendly output.

I have been trying to add to my skill set by learning about REST APIs and the tool Postman.  I built this simple application to demonstrate creating an API request and handling the response.
